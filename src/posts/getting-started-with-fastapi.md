I've recently started learning FastAPI and comparing it to my trusty framework of choice ([Express](https://expressjs.com/)), and I think come to really like its simple nature. FastAPI defines itself as a _"modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python"_. In this article, I'll try to get you up and running with FastAPI by building a simple Pizza API!

## Installation
You can install FastAPI by running the following command,
```
pip install fastapi
```
### Server
You can use either uvicorn or hypercorn for the server, both are great and do the same thing. I'll be using uvicorn for this tutorial. You can install them by running the following command,
```
pip install uvicorn
```
Or,
```
pip install hypercorn
```
That's all we need for this tutorial, let's get to the fun part!
