Navbars are an essential part of any kind of website. I often see beginners write tons and tons of CSS rules to position the navbar elements, and more CSS to make that responsive. So in this article, I'm going to show how you can create a simple navbar with just 7 CSS rules and build upon that.

## HTML Setup

Here's all the HTML that we're going to need to create the navbar. Note that I'm not using any classes for simplicity purposes but I recommend you to do so if you're planning to use this base for a project.
```html
<nav>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
